Hi everyone! Today I want to talk about brand-new .NET Core configuration system.

As all we know, new versions of `Microsoft's` frameworks were written in the modular model. (`ASP.NET` isn't one dll anymore, it's a set of packages which can be turned on by demand).

A few weeks ago, I decided to wrote a simple api-consumer with using of `ASP.NET Core`.

</figure>

So, I wanted to implement a simple app from `REST-endpoint` and `background service` for scraping data from `vk.com api`.
I planned that in the some interval of time background service makes requests to api and fetches fresh data. So, I decided to make a layer architecture.
After this decision, some interesting cases related with brand-new .NET core `configuration` system were found. I solved them by creating wrapper around this system.  
<a href="https://github.com/egorikas/dot-net-core-shared-configuration">Show me the code</a>

### Same setting for two or three projects
We all living in the world, where `microservices` is not a just another one hipster word, but also real tendency in the world of big systems' architecture. 
But I think that even in this world there is a place for settings which can be same for the multiple projects. And my web-scraper is about this situation. 

### Entity Framework Core and Migrations
Nowadays, DI is the importan part of .NET stack. If you want to configure
DbContext and open <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/miscellaneous/configuring-dbcontext">official documentation</a>, you will find some examples.

```csharp 			
public class BloggingContext : DbContext
{
    public BloggingContext(DbContextOptions<BloggingContext> options)
        : base(options)
    { }

    public DbSet<Blog> Blogs { get; set; }
}
```
At first glance everything's fine. But you'll have troubles, when you try to add migration with `dotnet ef migrations add {NameOfMigraion}`. You will have `System.MissingMethodException: No parameterless constructor defined for this object` problem. It can be fixed by adding custom `IDbContextFactory`. 
Custom factory allows us to construct context in the way we want to. But there is a big problem with `connection string`. How can we pass it to the context if application and IoC container aren't working in the moment, when migration is being created?
Official example offers us to hardcode `connection string`, such an awful practice.
```csharp 			
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Infrastructure;

namespace MyProject
{
    public class BloggingContextFactory : IDbContextFactory<BloggingContext>
    {
        public BloggingContext Create()
        {
            var optionsBuilder = new DbContextOptionsBuilder<BloggingContext>();
            optionsBuilder.UseSqlite("Data Source=blog.db");

            return new BloggingContext(optionsBuilder.Options);
        }
    }
}
```
I tried to find a existing solution. This <a href="https://www.benday.com/2017/02/17/ef-core-migrations-without-hard-coding-a-connection-string-using-idbcontextfactory/ ">blog-post</a> offers to write some custom methods for parsing settings file and getting connection string. As for me it breaks of `Single Responsibility Principle` and force us for creating coupled code.

### My solution
For resolving these cases I created a standalone project which works with settings and encapsulate logic for working with them in one place.

I decided to organise work through putting config files to the folder somewhere in the system and passing this folder's path to the application through `environment variables`.

So, my solution contains a few simple parts.
The first one encapsulates working with `environment variables`.
```csharp 			
public interface IEnvironmentProvider
{
    string EnvironmentName { get;}
    string SettingsPath { get; }
}
    
public class EnvironmentProvider : IEnvironmentProvider
{
    public string EnvironmentName => Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(ConfigurationConstants.EnvironmentVariableName);
    public string SettingsPath => Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(ConfigurationConstants.SettingsPathVariableName);
}

public class ConfigurationConstants
{
    public static string SettingsPathVariableName => "SHAREDSETTINGS_LOCATION";
    public static string EnvironmentVariableName => "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT";
    public static string SettingsFileName => "appsettings.json";
    public static string SettingsEnviromentFileName => "appsettings.{0}.json";
}
```
I am sure that hardcoding string can't be a good idea, so I like to put them to the special classes (recourses, files, etc). When I do this, I always know where these strings can be found. In this scenarion we also prevent creating hard-coded string with duplicate content.

The second part is the helper class which extracts and parses `IConfigurationRoot`.
```csharp 			
using System;
using Configuration.EnvironmentProvider;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;

namespace Configuration
{
    public class SettingsProvider
    {
        public static IConfigurationRoot GetConfigurationRoot(IEnvironmentProvider environmentProvider)
        {
            var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder()
                .SetBasePath(environmentProvider.SettingsPath)
                .AddJsonFile(ConfigurationConstants.SettingsFileName)
                .AddJsonFile(string.Format(ConfigurationConstants.SettingsEnviromentFileName, environmentProvider.EnvironmentName), optional: true)
                .AddEnvironmentVariables();

            return builder.Build();
        }      
    }
}
```
`IEnvironmentProvider` is being passed through constructor. So, we have some flexibility with changing it for different cases, but also have opportunity to write `unit-test` for `GetConfigurationRoot` fast.

After implementing this code `BloggingContextFactory` would be looking like in the snippet below.
```csharp 			
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Infrastructure;

namespace MyProject
{
    public class BloggingContextFactory : IDbContextFactory<BloggingContext>
    {
        public BloggingContext Create()
        {
            var configurationRoot = SettingsProvider.GetConfigurationRoot(new EnvironmentProvider());
            
            var optionsBuilder = new DbContextOptionsBuilder<BloggingContext>();
            //In my project I put "mainDb" to ConfigurationConstants class
            optionsBuilder.UseSqlite(configurationRoot.GetConnectionString("mainDb"));

            return new BloggingContext(optionsBuilder.Options);
        }
    }
}
```

No magic, no hard-code connection strings. Just flexibility and fun :).
